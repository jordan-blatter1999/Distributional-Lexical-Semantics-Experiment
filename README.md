# Distributional-Lexical-Semantics-Experiment
Created distributional semantic word vectors from scratch in Python using NumPy and SciPy. Computed the Euclidian distances between words in the corpus using created vectors. Tested accuracy with original vectors as well as SVD reduced vectors.  
Used COMPOSES toolkit word vectors and Google's 300-dimensional word2vec word vectors and Euclidian distances vs. cosine similarity on synonym detection task. Created synonym test set from synonym corpus.  
Used COMPOSES and Google's word2vec to answer SAT Analogy questions.
